<h1><b>Claudius Becomes Emperor</b></h1>
<p>
Claudius became Emperor at the age of 50. Fearing the attack of Caligula's<br>
assassins, Claudius hid behind some curtains. After a guardsman discovered<br>
him, Claudius dropped to the floor, and then found himself declared Emperor.<br>

<h1><b>Claudius is Poisoned</b></h1>
<p>
Most people think that Claudius was poisoned. Some think his wife Agrippina<br>

arrangements had been made for her son, Nero, to succeed as Emperor.<br>
